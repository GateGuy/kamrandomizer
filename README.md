# Amazing Mirror Randomizer
This is a randomizer for Kirby & The Amazing Mirror that changes the abilities you can obtain from each enemy. You will need a US ROM of Kirby & The Amazing Mirror to use this.

## Features
There are plenty of user options that can adjust how abilities are distributed. These are all explained in detail in the program, but some of them include:
- Group by original enemy grouping or original ability frequency
- Set % chance that an enemy will have an ability
- Include/ignore mini-bosses
- Include/ignore Minny and Wheelie (since their abilities are needed at certain parts of the game)
- Change the abilities of enemy-created objects (like Master Hand's missiles or Mr. Frosty's ice blocks)
- Create up to 20 randomized ROMs at once
- Seed input, so you can share your favorite seeds
- And more!

## Known bugs
- The following enemies cannot currently be randomized: Golem, Parasol Waddle Dee, Shadow Kirby
  - If you find any of these addresses yourself, let me know! I'll add them as soon as I know what they are.
- The following objects cannot currently be randomized: Boxy's Bomb, Master/Crazy Hand's Star
  - Again, let me know if you find any of these.
- For some reason, the first Waddle Doo in Rainbow Route cannot be randomized, though the rest can. There may be other enemies with this issue, but this is the only one I've found.

## Documentation
- Check the documentation for important ROM/RAM addresses, along with the two methods used for finding ability addresses.
